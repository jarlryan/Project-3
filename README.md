# Project-3
This program takes in user input in order to optimize a firms profits utilizing the concept of a while loop. 
The program considers: the total number of units, rent while all units are occupied, the increase in rent 
for every vacancy, and the amount required to maintain a unit. The program then calculates and prints the optimal 
number of units to be rented in order to maximize profit, and what the actual maximized profit will be in the long run.
